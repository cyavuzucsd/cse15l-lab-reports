After your terminal is open you want to copy the command below, but replace the three dashes with your unique code given to you:

`ssh cs15lwi23---@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

Once the screen asks your for your password:

## Trying some commands

Now that you are remotely connected it is time for you to try some commands. You can experiment with the commands we learned in class or try some of the ones below:

```
cd ~
cd
ls -lat
ls -a
ls <directory> where <directory> is /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/cs15lwi23abc, where the abc is one of the other group membersâ€™ username
cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt ~/
cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt
```
