# How to log into a course specific account on ieng6

Hello, this blog post will teach you and give you steps on how to log into your ieng6 account.

---

## Step 1: Visual Studio Code

In order to access your ieng6 account you will need to have a terminal. The Visual Studio Code editor has a terminal we can use and is where you will most likely do your programming assignments in the future. 

To download Visual Studio Code click this link:

[Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Once on screen click the button on the top right of the page to download the app as shown on the image below.

After downloading and opening the app your screen should look like this:

## Step 2: Remotely connecting

Once in Visual Studio Code you will want to press the sqaure with a rectangle on the bottom as shown in the image below:

Your terminal should look like below with the words specified for your device.

Since I am a Mac user I did not have to download bash since it was already on my laptop. Fow Windows users you may have to download bash which is a step I skipped since it was not necessary for me.

After your terminal is open you want to copy the command below, but replace the three dashes with your unique code given to you:

`ssh cs15lwi23---@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

Once the screen asks your for your password:

Enter the password you have created for your account.

Then you need to answer the following input as yes asking you if you would like to trust this computer.

Once you are connected it should look like below:

Hooray! You have remotely connected!

## Step 3: Trying some commands

Now that you are remotely connected it is time for you to try some commands. You can experiment with the commands we learned in class or try some of the ones below:

`cd ~`
`cd`
`ls -lat`
`ls -a`
`cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt ~/`
`cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt`
`ls <directory>` where `<directory>` is `/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/cs15lwi23---`, where --- is one of the other group membersâ€™ username

While I was in the lab I tried `ls -lat` whicgh gave me the output below. The ls command stands for list directory. Ls can be followed with a path such as ls <path> whuch would list all the files in that path. Inputting ls -lat would show all the files in the current directory in a list format with one file per line, as well as showing you the hidden files, all ordered with the last time they were modified. This happens because ls -lat uses three commands. ls -l whihc displayhs files in a list with one per line. ls -a which shows all the files including the hidden files. ls -t which organizes them by the tiome they were last modified.

As you can see from the image above the ls -lat command did exactly what was described. The files are listed with one file per line. The hidden files are also nshown and all organized by the time they were last modified. 

Then I tried `ls -a` which shows all the filed including the hidden ones. Trying this commmand aloine just displays the files. Not in a format or an order. Just displays them.:

As you can see in the image above the command did just that. It displayed all the files as well as the hidden ones.

I also tried `cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt`. The cat command displays the contents of a file without opening it. This can also be done with multiple files. As seen from the command it is directing its path to the hello.txt file in the remote computer. This way the contents of the hello.txt file can be displayed without the need of opening it or editing it.:

As you can see from the image above the command did exactly what it was supposed to do. It displayed the contents of the hello.txt file directly into the terminal. This way the user can see the message in the fuile which was "Hello! Welcome to CSE15L".

I ran all the commands which were on the week 1 website for CSE15L. I only included three screenshots to not make the lab report unnecessarily long. 

Congratulations! You have completed all the steps!
