# Lab Report 5

This lab report will cover how I did my favorite lab report which happened to be lab report 3.

## How did I do it?

This was one of my favorite lab report because I had the ability to do my own exploring and was not limited to a certain set of instructions. I was able to use the fascinating software fo chatGPT and test its output. Also it increased my knowledge in find and grep which was big bonus. I also happened to find times where the tool lacked. I'll talk about how I would have changed my approach when doing the lab as well.

## How did I research aboout `find`?

I went to chatGPT and created a new chat where I asked the chat bot to provide me with some find commands for the terminal. The chatbot provided me with around 8 commands and I picked the four which I thought I could write the most about. From my options I chose `type`, `size`, `perm`, and `path`. I believe that those four commands were also the most important when it came to the find command because it allowed the user to learn more about certain files in the computer. 

## How did I research the different commands of `find`?

As instructed by the lab guidelines I needed to provide two examples of me using those commands in the `./written-2` files and directory. Therefore I needed to come up with two different to diplay what each commands does.

For `type` I displayed that you can use `find d` for directories which I thought would be helpful to know as well as `find f` to find files which I also believed was important.

For `size` I wanted to display how it is important. I wanted to display how you can look for files with a certain size by using `find -size +500` and `find -size 1k`. 

When it came to `perm` I realized I had hit my favorite command. I thought that is possessed the most data since it gave informaiton on who can read, write and execute the files. This is an essential function to know to see who was access to what and can help a lot with privacy. In addition I did my own research and linked a table for others to understand how permissions work as well. I used `find -perm 750` and `find -perm 700`. 

Finally for `path` I wanted to display how you can use different paths to find different files. This commans can help our understanding on how to reach certain files. I used `find -path '*/non-fiction/OUP*'` to show all files in that path and `find -path '*/travel_guides/berlitz2*` to find the files in that path.

## What would I do differently?

I was pretty happy with this lab but if I were to go back and change my prodcedure I would think of a more critically thought prompt for chatGPT. I think my prompt was a big vague so therefore I had to do work to find our which commands were the best to ue. Next tie I can use a prompt like "Provide me with four find commands for the terminal that will give me the most data about files and will be most useful to know". This way I can enter more parameters into the chat bot expecting a more specific and more in depth response from it

## Conclusion

I am happy we got to do this lab and were allowed to use chatGPT. I will definitely use these commands I learned in the future and will apply chatGPT to my future projects as well.
