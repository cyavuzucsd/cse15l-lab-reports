# Lab Report 5

This lab report will cover how I did my favorite lab report which happened to be lab report 3.

## How did I do it?

This was one of my favorite lab report because I had the ability to do my own exploring and was not limited to a certain set of instructions. I was able to use the fascinating software fo chatGPT and test its output. Also it increased my knowledge in find and grep which was big bonus. I also happened to find times where the tool lacked. I'll talk about how I would have changed my approach when doing the lab as well.

## How did I research aboout `find`?
