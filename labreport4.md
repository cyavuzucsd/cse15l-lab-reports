# Lab Report 4

This lab report will cover the steps I took to complete the taks assigned in lab during week 7. It will be from step 4 to 9.

## Step 4
To complete step 4 of the lab I copied and pasted my ieng6 email using `Command-C` and `Command-V`. Then I pressed `<enter>` to achieve the screenshot below:

## Step 5

To start step 5 I went to the lab7 repo. Then I copied the ssh key using `Command-C`. Afterwards I typed in `git clone` into the terminal and pasted the ssh key to clone the repository using `Command-V`. Finally I pressed `<enter>` to get the screenshot below.

## Step 6 

After cloning the repository I typed in `cd l` and then pressed `<tab>` to autocomplete to `cd lab7/`. After I used `Command-C` to copy the first test command from the week 3 lab and `Command-V` to paste it which then I pressed `<enter>`. Then I did the same process for the second test command. After pasting the second test commands I typed in `L` then pressed `<tab>` then pressed `T` followed by `<tab>`. Finally I pressed `<enter>` to get the image below.

## Step 7

After seeing the tests failed I typed in `nan` then followed with `<tab>` to autocomplete to `nano `. I then typed in `L` then presed `<tab>` to autocomplete to `nano ListExamples` which then I finished up by typing `.j` and then `<tab>` to autocomplete to `nano ListExamples.java`. Once the nano system opened up I pressed `Control-V` to go to the next page and then `<down><down><down><down><down><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right>` and then `<backspace>` and then `2` to fix the bug and get the image below:

Then I exited the interface using `Control-X` and `Y` and `<enter>` to exit and save my changes.

## Step 8

To run the tests again I pressed `<up><up><up>` to get the first test message and then pressed <enter>. I repeated the previous step for the second test command to get the image below:
